### 5. OTHER IDEAS TO DIVERSIFY YOUR INCOME STREAMS

You are encouraged to research and experiment with the following:

- Stocks and shares: your money buys a small part of a company or set of companies. The most common model is to buy cheap and sell expensive, but you could generate money by other means such as dividends.
- Bonds: Estates and companies issue debt that you can buy. Effectively you are lending them money, for an interest.
- Funds: you put your money in a pool that is managed by professional managers who allocate the funds into different assets. 
- Real estate: the underlying assets are land and buildings.
- Crowdfunding: big amounts of people provide micro-investments for a high total.
- Dropshipping: buying products online and selling them for a profit.
- Peer to peer loans: your money is available for people to borrow, and you keep the interest. The investment is spread across borrowers.
- Crypto trading: trading cryptocurrencies. Buy low, sell high.
-Robo-trading: an algorithmic robot allocates your funds in different assets. Like funds, but in a smaller scale, automated and frequently tailored.
