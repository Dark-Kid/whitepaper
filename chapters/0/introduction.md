##### WHERE DO I START?

This guide assumes you have a job and a salary. At this stage it's not important how much you get paid, what's important is that you have a reliable periodic income of money. At the same time you also have liabilities, or expenses: your rent or mortgage, bills, groceries expenses, children's education, your ex's monthly payment... Most people are careless with money and don't prepare for eventualities, spending the whole or most of their salary every month. Besides, they usually spend the most on the first days after getting it, which means the rest of the month they will be in a worse scarcity situation, not realising how much wealth they are letting slip through their fingers.

It will also imagine you have little to no savings. This guide helps you on how to get started from zero savings. You may or may not have a mortgage. This is always a right financial decision, but we need to choose the right moment to do so, both in our lives and the real state market.

##### A NOTE ABOUT TAXES

Before we start, it's worth making some mentions about taxes.

Most people have an allowance of £1000 earned in interest every year. That means the first £1000 you make every tax year are tax-free.

ISAs are a very powerful instrument for increasing your wealth. They allow you to put money away while getting your interest tax-free. You can find more information on [https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts)

##### A NOTE ABOUT CREDIT SCORE

Your credit score measures how attractive you are for banks to lend you money. It represents how reliable you are to return that money in time. In this guide we will need to create some current/savings/ISA accounts, so we will need to keep an eye on the credit score to do this successfully. This is because most current accounts have some overdraft associated, which counts as credit, so you won't be granted one unless you have a worthy score.

There are three Credit Score Agencies in the UK: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. All three of them offer services for you to track and improve your score, but those are paid services. However, for each provider there is a free alternative provider you can use, so you can stay on top of our credit score.

If you need to apply for a new current account, credit card or loan, you should check your credit score to know whether you are likely to be approved, before applying. In case your score is not high enough, you can build it with Credit Score Building Credit Cards. The aforementioned tools can also suggest you credit card offers tailored for you, in some cases pre-approved.
