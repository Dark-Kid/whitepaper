4. LEARN ABOUT INVESTING

When you invest you money is at risk. This means you could potentially get better results than with your savings, but you could also end up with less money that you started, so do it at your own risk, and invest only what you can afford to lose. If you are prepared, there are lots of ways to do so nowadays, especially online.

Some investing financial products come in an ISA wrapper, allowing you to earn your interest tax-free. Some of them are detailed below, with promotions an referral bonuses included:
- Moneyfarm: It's a robo-trading application: you create an account according yo your needs and invest your money into it. Once there, it gets split across different investment products, according to your investment profile.
